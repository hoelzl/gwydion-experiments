Gwydion Experiments
===================

This is a repository for some experiments with the Gwydion Dylan
compiler that are not appropriate for the official svn repository but
that I didn't want to do without support from revision control.  The
initial version of the repository was forked from Gwydion svn revision
12904; this branch has been updated to svn revision 12941.
